		<b>1 ) What is Zablance?</b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Zablance is an online outsourcing platform that puts
		businesses and employers in contact with a global network of
		Zablances. Any member can post a project, whether a short- or
		long-term job, and choose from skilled Zablances who offer rate
		quotes and time estimates for completing the work. It's a mutually
		beneficial arrangement. Employers can have their pick of thousands of
		Zablances who have the exact skills needed to get the job done,
		without undertaking the expense and commitment of hiring full-time
		employees. Zablances can tap into a readily available source of
		constant part-time and full-time work opportunities from employers who
		are specifically seeking them out.</p>
